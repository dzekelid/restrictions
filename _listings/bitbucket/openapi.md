      summary: Add Repositories Username Repo Slug Branch Restrictions
      description: |-
        Creates a new branch restriction rule for a repository.

        `kind` describes what will be restricted. Allowed values are: `push`,
        `force`, `delete`, and `restrict_merges`.

        Different kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements:

        * `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be
          specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is
          denied for everybody.
        * `force` can not be specified in a Mercurial repository.

        `pattern` is used to determine which branches will be restricted.

        A `'*'` in `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and
        every other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match
        `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all
        branches.

        `users` and `groups` are lists of user names and group names.

        `kind` and `pattern` must be unique within a repository; adding new
        users or groups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`.

        Note that branch restrictions with overlapping patterns are allowed,
        but the resulting behavior may be surprising.
